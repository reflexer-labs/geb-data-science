What is it ?
################

**fitter** package provides a simple class to identify the distribution from which a data samples 
is generated from. It uses 80 distributions from Scipy and allows you to plot the results to check 
what is the most probable distribution and the best parameters.


Installation
###################

::

    pip install fitter

**fitter** is also available on **conda** (bioconda channel)::

     conda install fitter

And as a singularity file in `damona <https://damona.readthedocs.io>`::

    pip install damona
    damona install fitter


Usage
##################

standalone
===========

A standalone application (very simple) is also provided and works with input CSV
files::

    fitter fitdist data.csv --column-number 1 --distributions gamma,normal

It creates a file called fitter.png and a log fitter.log

From Python shell
==================

First, let us create a data samples with N = 10,000 points from a gamma distribution::

    from scipy import stats
    data = stats.gamma.rvs(2, loc=1.5, scale=2, size=10000)

.. note:: the fitting is slow so keep the size value to reasonable value.

Now, without any knowledge about the distribution or its parameter, what is the distribution that fits the data best ? Scipy has 80 distributions and the **Fitter** class will scan all of them, call the fit function for you, ignoring those that fail or run forever and finally give you a summary of the best distributions in the sense of sum of the square errors. The best is to give an example::


    from fitter import Fitter
    f = Fitter(data)
    f.fit()
    # may take some time since by default, all distributions are tried
    # but you call manually provide a smaller set of distributions 
    f.summary()

========= ==========================================================================
Version   Description
========= ==========================================================================
1.4.0     * get_best function returns now returns the parameters as a dictionary 
            of parameter names and their values rather than just a list of
            values (https://github.com/cokelaer/fitter/issues/23) thanks to 
            contributor @kabirmdasraful
          * 
1.3.0     * parallel process implemented https://github.com/cokelaer/fitter/pull/25
            thanks to @arsenyinfo 
1.2.3     * remove vervose arguments in Fitter class. Using the logging module 
            instead
          * the Fitter.fit has now a progress bar
          * add a standalone application called â€¦ fitter (see the doc)
1.2.2     was not released
1.2.1     adding new class called histfit (see documentation)
1.2       * Fixed the version. Previous version switched from 
            1.0.9 to 1.1.11. To start a fresh version, we increase to 1.2.0
          * Merged pull request required by bioconda
          * Merged pull request related to implementation of 
            AIC/BIC/KL criteria (https://github.com/cokelaer/fitter/pull/19). 
            This also fixes https://github.com/cokelaer/fitter/issues/9
          * Implement two functions to get all distributions, or a list of 
            common distributions to help users decreading computational time 
            (https://github.com/cokelaer/fitter/issues/20). Also added a FAQS 
            section.
          * travis tested Python 3.6 and 3.7 (not 3.5 anymore)
1.1       * Fixed deprecated warning
          * fitter is now in readthedocs at fitter.readthedocs.io
1.0.9     * https://github.com/cokelaer/fitter/pull/8 and 11
            PR https://github.com/cokelaer/fitter/pull/8
1.0.6     * summary() now returns the dataframe (instead of printing it)
1.0.5      https://github.com/cokelaer/fitter/issues
1.0.2     add manifest to fix missing source in the pypi repository.
